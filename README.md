## Description

This project provides two libraries for accessing the memory of MSX systems. 

Use them for developing MSX applications using Small Device C Compiler (SDCC).

You can access the documentation here with [`How to use the library`](docs/HOWTO.md).

In the source code [`examples/`](examples/), you can find applications for testing and learning purposes.

This project is an Open Source library. You can add part or all of this code in your libraries/engines.

These libraries are part of the [MSX fR3eL Project](https://github.com/mvac7/SDCC_MSX_fR3eL).

Enjoy it!
